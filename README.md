###Insights and Findings
####Top Performing Categories by Views and Likes:
Music is the dominant category with over 5.6 billion views and more than 345K likes, making it the most popular and engaging genre.
People & Blogs, Entertainment, and Comedy also perform strongly in both views and likes, highlighting their broad appeal.
Gaming and Sports show significant engagement but lower overall views compared to the top categories.

####Dislikes Distribution by Category:
Music and Entertainment receive the highest number of dislikes, likely due to higher viewership.
Categories such as Science & Technology, Education, and Nonprofits receive relatively fewer dislikes, possibly reflecting niche or informative content with targeted audiences.

####Publishing Trends Over the Years:
There was a massive spike in views and likes around 2019, suggesting a peak in viral content or platform growth.
Recent years (2023â€“2024) show a resurgence in video performance, indicating increased engagement or improved content strategies.

####Likes vs Views Relationship:
While Music leads in both metrics, some categories like Education and Science & Technology show relatively fewer likes despite moderate views, hinting at passive consumption.
