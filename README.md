### DATA SOURCE:
The only dataset used in this analysis is the "Top Trending YouTube Videos.csv", obtained from Kaggle website.

### TOOLS
- Microsoft Excel - Data Cleaning
- PowerBi - Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)/Visualization and creating report

## DATA CLEANING
In the data cleaning phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data Loading and inspection
2. Handling missing data
3. Data formatting

### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
- How many videos are concerned?
- What is the Total views?
- What is the Total Likes?
- What is the Total Dislikes?

### RESULTS
- Total Videos Analyzed: 994
- Total Views: 25 Billion
- Total Likes: 155 Million
- Total Dislikes: 1 Million


### INSIGHTS AND FINDINGS
#### 1. Top Performing Categories by Views and Likes:
- Music is the dominant category with over 5.6 billion views and more than 345K likes, making it the most popular and engaging genre.
- People & Blogs, Entertainment, and Comedy also perform strongly in both views and likes, highlighting their broad appeal.
- Gaming and Sports show significant engagement but lower overall views compared to the top categories.

#### 2. Dislikes Distribution by Category:
- Music and Entertainment receive the highest number of dislikes, likely due to higher viewership.
- Categories such as Science & Technology, Education, and Nonprofits receive relatively fewer dislikes, possibly reflecting niche or informative content with targeted audiences.

#### 3. Publishing Trends Over the Years:
- There was a massive spike in views and likes around 2019, suggesting a peak in viral content or platform growth.
- Recent years (2023–2024) show a resurgence in video performance, indicating increased engagement or improved content strategies.

#### 4. Likes vs Views Relationship:
- While Music leads in both metrics, some categories like Education and Science & Technology show relatively fewer likes despite moderate views, hinting at passive consumption.

### RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Capitalize on High-Engagement Categories
- Focus content creation and marketing efforts on Music, People & Blogs, Entertainment, and Comedy—these categories consistently generate high views and likes, indicating strong audience interest and engagement.
- Collaborations with influencers or creators in these categories can amplify reach and boost campaign success.

2. Enhance Content Quality in High-Dislike Categories
- While Music and Entertainment receive the highest dislikes, this may reflect the sheer volume of views. However, it also signals a need to monitor audience sentiment and improve content quality or engagement strategies (e.g., responding to feedback, refining video titles/thumbnails).

3. Nurture Niche Categories for Educational or Informative Content
- Education, Science & Technology, and Nonprofits show low dislike rates but relatively modest engagement. These categories can benefit from targeted promotion and interactive formats (e.g., live Q&A, tutorials) to convert passive viewers into active engagers.

Consider collaborations with academic institutions or experts to boost credibility and interest.

4. Leverage Historical Trends for Strategic Publishing
- The 2019 spike suggests a period of viral growth. Analyze content formats and trends from that year to replicate successful patterns.
- With recent increases in 2023–2024, continue to invest in video production and track algorithm changes or user behavior that may be driving renewed engagement.

5. Encourage Interaction in Passive Consumption Categories
- Categories like Education and Science & Tech, despite moderate views, have lower likes—indicating passive viewing.
- Encourage engagement by adding calls to action (e.g., “Like if you found this useful”), interactive elements, or community polls.

6. Optimize for Platform Algorithms
- Since likes and watch time are key metrics for algorithmic promotion, focus on producing compelling intros, retention-friendly formats, and high-engagement content to increase visibility across all categories.

7. Monitor and Adapt Content Strategies
- Regularly review performance data to identify emerging trends and adapt content strategies. This is especially important given the recent upward trend, which could indicate new content types or topics gaining popularity.


### LIMITATIONS
There were some videos that neither had a like or dislike which might lead to inconsistency.
